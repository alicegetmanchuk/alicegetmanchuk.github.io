Something I realized in college is that I'm interested in project management. While I love how technical engineering is, I also need something that looks at the business in a broader scope. Rather than just completing a technical task, I also want to think about how it affects the business: cost, impact, efficiency, etc. 

I'm interested in software engineering or project management positions. Through my various job opportunities, I have worked in the telecommunication, financial technology, and energy industry. I currently have experience with cloud computing, databases, and some front-end. Please reach out if you have any exciting job opportunties!

<small>^^That's me on a combine!</small>

As you've probably noticed, my name is Alice. I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who's also minoring in the Hoeft Technology and Management Program. Aside from my academics, I love taking fun photos (such as the one above!), spending time with friends, and baking!

To stay up-to-date, I like to read the Morning Brew and the NYT. I love being the person that knows at least a little about every topic, so I like to try everything at least once. My latest venture is investing. I have a small portfolio that I've been maintaining that I'm hoping will grow!
